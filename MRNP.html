        <h1>Mount Rainier National Parks</h1>
        <p>"Of all the fire mountains which, like beacons, once blazed along the Pacific Coast, Mount Rainier is the noblest." <br>
          John Muir, 1901

      <p> A mountain of immeasurable inspiration, Mount Rainier is the center of the nation's fifth national park. 
          It is a place of discovery and of personal triumphs, where family traditions endure.</p>

      <p> At 14,410 feet, the mountain is the tallest volcano in the Cascade Mountain Range and the most glaciated peak in the contiguos United States. 
          Basalt columns and other remnants of early eruptions and lava flows reveal Mount Rainier's ancient geologic history.</p>

      <p> Glaciers, massive rivers of ice up to 750 feet deep, flow down the rocky slopes. 
          Yet, on the summit, steam escapes from deep within the mountain's core, a reminder that it is still an active volcano.</p>

      <p> Above Mount Rainier, millions of stars illuminate the night sky.
          The Park minimizes the use of artificial light.
          This preserves darkness, through which constellations and planets are remarkably visible.</p>    
        
      <p> In spring, snow melts first in the foothills. Beneath the old-growth forest, flowers blooms and ferns undfurl. 
          Across the subapline region, summer may only last twon months. Adaptations that have taken centuries to develop prove crucial in a race for survival. 
          Profuse wildflower displays and pollinating insects bring life to the meadows. Birds and mammalas forage on the abundance before winter quickly returns.</p>

      <p> Entering the park is a step back in time - a portal into Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District. Roads, buildings, and other structures were designed nearly 100 years ago. 
          Massive logs and round river boulders characterize early national park rustic architecture, which harmonizes with the park's natural scenery. </p> 
        
      <p> For thousands of years, Mount Rainier has been an important place for Pacific Northwest Indigenous people.
          Nearly two million people from around the world now visit Mount Rainier National Park each year.
          As global development increases, this mountain remains steadfast, a place where people can reconnect with what is important in their lives.</p>
